                    <h5>SELECTION OF POCKET MONSTERS</h5>
                    <p>Pocket monsters have distinct characters such as life, attack and
                        special attack mode for players to choose.</p>
                    <h5>POKECT MONSTER CREATED BY COMPUTER</h5>
                    <p>The pocket monster controlled by computer will be randomly selected.</p>
                    <h5>GAME WINNER</h5>
                    <p>The winner will be the pocket monster who has the positive health point
                        after combat damage step if the opponent pocket monster has no more than zero  health point.</p>
                    <h5>GAME TIE</h5>
                    <p>This will happen if two pocket monsters both have negative health point after combat damage step.</p>
                    <h5>BATTLE STARTS</h5>
                    <p>The turn player declares that they are beginning their combat phase. The player chooses the
                        attack mode before its combat phase.</p>
                    <h5>BATTLE DAMAGE STEP</h5>
                    <p>The attack mode of pocket monster controlled by computer will be randomly selected to attack.
                        Pocket monsters deal damage equal to their power at the time of combat phase. </p>
                    <h5>BATTLE END STEP</h5>
                    <p>Both pocket monsters will check their health point at the end of each combat phase. If one of
                        them has
                        negative health point and the other has positive health point , the winner will be the one with positive
                        health point. If
                        both of them have positive health point, the combat continues to the second round until there is a
                        winner. If both of the have negative health point at the end of combat phase, there is a tie game.</p>
                    <h5>GAME OVER</h5>
                    <p>The screen will show whether the winner is player or computer and the game can be restarted from the pocket monsterâ€™s selection page.</p>
